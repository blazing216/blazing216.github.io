# Research Interests
I am now focusing on understanding the seismic, thermal and compositional structure of 
the crust and mantle at various scales, using high-quality surface wave measurements 
along with datasets from other disciplines.

I also have a broad research background, including noise interferometry 
(both cross-correlation and autocorrelation) and numericial
simulation of offshore air gun sources and downhole seismic sources.
