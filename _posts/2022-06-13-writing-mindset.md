I have been struggling with writing academic papers for a long time, which has profoundly affected my career.

Today I was doing my usual searching of 'tips on academic writing' to start up my writing when I found the blog [Overcoming essay-writing phobia](https://blog.une.edu.au/usingpsychology/2011/09/30/do-you-have-essay-writing-phobia/comment-page-1/).

It confirms again that fear of writing is not a sole experience of mine. But what I found striking and mind-blowing is the sentence below,
> Change your goal to something realistic and valuable, like doing your best under the circumstances or submitting on time or ending your avoidance. Put aside goals of being perfect and impressing the heck out of someone.

This is the first suggestion among the 10 strategies in the post. When I read the suggestion, I feel the heavy burden on my chest is lifted. 'Doing your best under the circumstance' sounds much easier than 'impressing the heck out of someone'. The latter has been my goal of writing for a long time (maybe since the beginning of my academic life, since the starting of my PhD). 'Doing your best' is a realistic goal, which anyone can achieve. 

This reminds me of the mindset shifting since I moved abroad, which is being realistic and understanding that you are just a normal human being. This mindset shift does not mean I stop working hard, instead, it often makes me work more efficiently and effectively. The shifting relieves the mental burden from me that paralyzed me.

I will carefully set realistic goals for my future writing tasks and let us see if it works.
