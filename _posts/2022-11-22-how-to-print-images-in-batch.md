Occasionally, you may need to print a set of images with a specific
printer settings. For example, `landspace` + `scale to fit` + `fit to image` + `single-sided`. The following tip will save you from the tedious
iteration of opening a file, change settings and print.

Assume the image files (*.jpg, *.png, etc.) are in the same folder, 
- Select all the files your want to print, either by (1) drag a box
around the files; (2) select the first one, hold Shift, and then click the 
last one; (3) hold Command and select each file you need.
- Open with `Preview`
- Press `Command + P`, which opens up the printer window
- If applicable, Change the settings of the printer 
- Print
