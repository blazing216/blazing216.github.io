Writing papers can divived into several processes. Preparing, Brainstorming, draft, revise, revise, revise and submit, and revise more. 
The revision stage is semi-automatic driven your and your collaborators' critical eyes. 
The actually creative part is how to make the first draft. 

## How to reach the first draft
I have gained new understanding of how to write the first draft, greatly inspired
by the 'Essay Writing Guide' by Prof. Jordan B Peterson. I started with following 
exactly his guide, but began to tweak it to suit my own suitation. 

The first observation during the application of Prof. Peterson's Guide is that 
writing papers may take more iterations than writing essays. I found there are
loads of details that need to be figured out during write, probably because a 
combination of my perfectism and the data-oriented nature of seismology.
The second observation is that new ideas and the suitable organisation of the 
paper come during the first few iterations of the writing.

Therefore, it feels unnecessary to focus on revising sentences too much
in the first iteration before deciding the actual structure of the paper. 
Often, I found myself deleting one or more paragraphs when finalsing the
writing. These paragraphs are more like exploratory writing, which records
my braindump. They are really useful as the base of the more structured thinking
afterwards, but polishing them seems worthless.

I think the way that suits me better is to focus on the structure first. 
Starts with a draft outline, write explorately, do reading and fix details, 
do more exploratory writing, then organise them, read them, write a new outline,
paste the sentences in the new outline. Then I get the first draft that I can 
apply the guide of Prof. Peterson.

The process before the first draft might be similar to the reading and taking 
notes in the guide. I think it is. But a difference is to use exploratory writing 
to generate ideas.

The exploratory writing may be useful in other stages of writing. I think
I may use the technique a few times before, because I always rewrite largely 
my drafts and the draft only becomes stable after two or three times of 
rewriting. Maybe that is because I was actually doing exploratory writing 
in the first one or two drafts.

The lesson for me is that I can start to write early on, to note down my thoughts,
explore new ideas, which can create a collection of rich documents when I 
start to write the 'first draft' later on.

## First draft
The first draft focuses on the logic of paper. 
You should have a theme argument (Introduction), reasoning (Discussion) and evidence (Data, Method and Results). A background is often useful for a wide audience (Introduction). 
The challenge is you need to come up with a logic with linear structure, so readers can follow you logic when skimming through your paper.
Two actual challenge are (1) you have no idea how to come up with such a structure; (2) you have many options but cannot decide which is the best.

## How to decide the logic of the draft
The second one is more painful than the first one. It is not uncommon that one experiment may produce evidences that provide insights to various questions. 
Even for a single question, you can formulate it in various ways, smaller or larger.
Although when you want to answer a larger question, evidences from other studies will be needed. It means more effort and less likely to be convincing but also is more likely to end up in a higher impact journal. 

When formulating the questions, it might be good to keep a few options range from smaller and larger. For example, questions with sure-answers and questions with larger impact. 
We can delay the choice later and chose the largest question with sufficient evidence.
Larger questions are valuable too. They lead to more research questions for future studies.

Once the research question is decided, the logic is obvious.

## How to formulate research questions

### Copy or Modify the one in the research plan
If a research plan is written before the study started, the plan can be a good source for research questions

### Start from the results and ask "so what".
It is very unlikely that a researcher do research for no reasons. It is more likely that we find something surprising and unexpected by-products and try to explore its significance.

### Start from a list of related questions and decide which one the results contribute the most.
I am not sure if this works. It is more helpful when trying to think of a idea for proposals.
Actually, formulating a research question is similar to writing proposals.


## Organisation of the folder structure
I found that, besides a messy and large folder structure that keeps all the information you created during the research, it is good to have a small folder that stores selected, organised dataset/figures/documents that distilled from the research process.

For example, a set of figures for a certain manuscript.
