Writing papers can divived into several processes. Preparing, Brainstorming, draft, revise, revise, revise and submit, and revise more. 
The revision stage is semi-automatic driven your and your collaborators' critical eyes. 
The actually creative part is how to make the first draft. 

## First draft
The first draft focuses on the logic of paper. 
You should have a theme argument (Introduction), reasoning (Discussion) and evidence (Data, Method and Results). A background is often useful for a wide audience (Introduction). 
The challenge is you need to come up with a logic with linear structure, so readers can follow you logic when skimming through your paper.
Two actual challenge are (1) you have no idea how to come up with such a structure; (2) you have many options but cannot decide which is the best.

## How to decide the logic of the draft
The second one is more painful than the first one. It is not uncommon that one experiment may produce evidences that provide insights to various questions. 
Even for a single question, you can formulate it in various ways, smaller or larger.
Although when you want to answer a larger question, evidences from other studies will be needed. It means more effort and less likely to be convincing but also is more likely to end up in a higher impact journal. 

When formulating the questions, it might be good to keep a few options range from smaller and larger. For example, questions with sure-answers and questions with larger impact. 
We can delay the choice later and chose the largest question with sufficient evidence.
Larger questions are valuable too. They lead to more research questions for future studies.

Once the research question is decided, the logic is obvious.

## How to formulate research questions

### Copy or Modify the one in the research plan
If a research plan is written before the study started, the plan can be a good source for research questions

### Start from the results and ask "so what".
It is very unlikely that a researcher do research for no reasons. It is more likely that we find something surprising and unexpected by-products and try to explore its significance.

### Start from a list of related questions and decide which one the results contribute the most.
I am not sure how this works. It is more helpful when trying to think of a idea for proposals.
Actually, formulating a research question is similar to writing proposals.
